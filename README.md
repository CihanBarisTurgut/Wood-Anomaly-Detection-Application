# Wood-Anomaly-Detection-Application
React is used in the front end of this project and Python Flask is used in the back end.

*DRAEM*, *FastFlow* and *Dinomaly* models were trained specifically for the wood class in the MVTec AD dataset.

You can find the sources and articles of these models from the link below. **https://paperswithcode.com/sota/anomaly-detection-on-mvtec-ad**

You need to download the model files of each model, previously trained in Colab for 20 minutes, from the link below and upload them to the folders, for example backend/models/dinomaly etc.
